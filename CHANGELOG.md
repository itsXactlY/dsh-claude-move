# CHANGELOG

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versions follow [SemVer](https://semver.org/).

## [0.3.3] - 2026-08-31

### Fixed

- `move_preview` 工具输出不再包含显式 `undefined` 键（`previewPlan` 对 `new` 项不带 `reason`）：DSH 引擎对工具 body 值做 lossless JSON 快照，显式 `undefined` 键会让整个工具报 `value is not lossless JSON`，导致预览（及 `/move` 向导预览步骤）对所有源不可用。`move_run` 报告里 `newSessions[].title` 同样改为缺省省略。

## [0.3.2] - 2026-08-31

### Added

- Daedalus 第五源：`/move` 向导新增 Daedalus（Nous Research Python agent）迁移——`$DAEDALUS_HOME`（缺省 `~/.daedalus`）下白名单只读 `sessions/`、`skills/`、`memories/` 与 `SOUL.md`；`session_*.json` 会话（user/assistant/tool 消息 + OpenAI `tool_calls`）转换为平衡事件流并可续聊，技能复制、记忆/指令追加为 `AGENTS.md` 管理段。新增 `daedalusHome` 配置项、五语 README 与测试同步更新。

## [0.3.1] - 2026-08-30

### Fixed

- `scripts/loader-runner.mjs` 不再从 `@deepseek-ai/dsh-llm` 导入 `CallId` 品牌（宿主 master 已更名 `ToolCallId`）：改用本地恒等工厂，双基线（已发布 rc 线与 0.1.2-alpha.1 checkout）均可运行。

## [0.3.0] - 2026-08-26

### Added

- DSH 会话回迁 Claude jsonl 双向导出：新增 `claude_export` 工具与 `/claude-export` 命令，把 DSH 会话导出回 Claude 的 jsonl 格式。

### Fixed

- Use platform-neutral absolute paths in the export path tests (CI).

## [0.2.7] - 2026-08-23

### Changed

- Tighten the `@deepseek-ai/schemastery` peer range from `>=3.0.0` to `^3.18.0` to match the range every other DSH plugin declares (and the harness's pinned `3.18.x` line); `>=3.0.0` over-claimed API compatibility across 3.x minors.

## [0.2.6] - 2026-08-22

### Changed

- Upgrade to DeepSeek Harness `0.1.1-rc.2`: all 14 `@deepseek-ai/dsh-*` devDependencies pinned to exact `0.1.1-rc.2`, the compatibility declaration bumped to `0.1.1-rc.2`, and the CI compat matrix re-pinned to `0.1.1-rc.2`. The `@deepseek-ai/dsh-tools` peer range stays `>=0.1.0-rc.8 <0.2.0` (no consumed seam requires an rc.2-only API). No behavior change: every consumed seam (`defineTool` output schemas, sync `systemPrompt` providers, single-`CommandInvocation` command handlers, `skills.registerProvider`, `webServer.register` exact routes, `SESSION_FORMAT_VERSION=0` session persistence) is unchanged in rc.2. Verified by the full gate (214 tests, coverage, lint, readme sync, self-contained, artifacts) and a real keyless headless smoke on an rc.2 profile (`dsh-base` + `dsh-headless` + `dsh-claude-move` against a deterministic mock LLM, `SMOKE-OK`).

## [0.2.5] - 2026-08-21

### Changed

- Upgrade to DeepSeek Harness `0.1.0-rc.8`: all 14 `@deepseek-ai/dsh-*` devDependencies pinned to exact `0.1.0-rc.8`, the `@deepseek-ai/dsh-tools` peer range widened to `>=0.1.0-rc.8 <0.2.0`, the compatibility declaration bumped to rc.8, and the CI compat matrix re-pinned to rc.8. No behavior change: every consumed seam (`defineTool` output schemas, sync `systemPrompt` providers, `skills.registerProvider`, `webServer.register` exact routes, `SESSION_FORMAT_VERSION=0` session persistence) is unchanged in rc.8. Verified by the full gate (214 tests, coverage, lint, readme sync, self-contained, artifacts) and a real keyless headless smoke on an rc.8 profile (`dsh-base` + `dsh-headless` + `dsh-claude-move` against a deterministic mock LLM, `SMOKE-OK`).

## [0.2.4] - 2026-08-19

### Changed

- `package.json#dshWorkshop.lifecycle.activation` upgraded from `restart-profile` to `hot-reload`: with the panel routes riding the plugin fiber since 0.2.3, dispose-and-reactivate is fully clean. Proven by a Loader-level hot-reload composition test that drives `Include.refresh()` — the same transaction the HMR watcher triggers — through an `enableWebPanel` true → false → true cycle against a duplicate-strict mock `webServer`, asserting the routes unload with the fiber and re-register without a duplicate route.

## [0.2.3] - 2026-08-19

### Fixed

- The web panel routes now unload with the plugin fiber: the five `/api/claude-move/*` route disposers ride one `ctx.effect`, so a config hot-reload or disable followed by a remount no longer throws `duplicate exact route` (the host route table previously kept handlers closed over the unloaded fiber). The route tests now simulate fiber disposal against a duplicate-strict `webServer.register`.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-08-16

### Fixed

- The wizard's managed-section markers now accept any path-shaped plan key (8.3 short names like `RUNNER~1`, spaces, and every other path character), so `AGENTS.md` sections keyed by source paths stay idempotent on every platform.
- The migration manifest store resolves `$DSH_HOME` lazily per operation instead of binding it at module import (isolated tests and temporary profiles no longer share the default home).
- Converted skills record the source digest as `digest`, so re-runs recognize them as unchanged.
- Path assertions in the test suite are platform-agnostic (`path.join`), so the full gate is green on Windows, macOS and Linux.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-08-16

### Added

- Four-source migration wizard (`/move` command + `move_detect` / `move_preview` / `move_run` tools): Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode and Hermes, each with its own parser + mapper.
- Mapping: memories/instructions → append-only managed sections in the DSH global `AGENTS.md`; skills → real DSH skills (`SKILL.md` bundles copied verbatim, other formats converted); slash commands → registered DSH commands rebuilt from the manifest after a restart; sessions → resumable DSH sessions (phase-1 importers reused).
- Idempotency: every applied plan is recorded in `$DSH_HOME/claude-move/move.json` (`digest` / `targetDigest` / `appliedAt`); re-runs skip unchanged items, `force` re-applies, conflicts surface as diffs with explicit resolution (`skip` / `overwrite` / `rename` / `merge`, default skip).
- Approval gate: any run that would write asks `ctx.approval` first (`allowed-once` only; otherwise zero writes).
- New config: `requireApproval` / `codexHome` / `opencodeDataHome` / `opencodeConfigHome` / `hermesHome` / `skillsDir` / `agentsMdPath` / `moveWorkspaceMode`.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-15

### Added

- Chunked streaming import for transcripts over `maxTranscriptBytes` (`fs.streamText` + a streaming converter): first import creates on the first batch, grown sources append from the stored length, `force` saves a new copy; per-line secret scanning keeps working; hosts without a streaming surface keep the loud rejection (C3).
- Parallel project scanning (`scanConcurrency`, default 8) with unchanged determinism; `gitBranch` reuse and a three-level `scanGit` (`true` / `'branch'` / `false`) that skips `rev-parse` when the transcript already carries the branch (C1/C2).
- `claude_scan` output trimming (`projectsLimit` / `sessionsLimit` / `fields: 'brief'`) and a `removedBookmarks` count for deleted source files (C4/C5).
- Memory injection scoping (`memoryScope`): current-project-only by default (all projects fall back when the cwd has no project), `all` puts the current project first (B3).
- Project-level Claude skills (`<cwd>/.claude/skills`) exposed per `options.cwd`, with `path`/`metadata` candidates and `signal` support (B2).
- `/claude-move-reset` command + panel button + `POST /api/claude-move/reset` route: resets only the plugin cache files, imported sessions are kept (D5).
- Panel import jobs: `DELETE /api/claude-move/job` cancellation (panel cancel button), optional `ctx.jobs` registration for official kill/UI surfaces, and Origin/Host checks (403 for cross-origin) on state-changing routes (B5/D4/D6).
- Panel now opens imported sessions in place via the shell's `sessions.open`, refreshes the session list via `sessions.refresh`/`workspaces.refresh` (feature-detected, falls back to reload), shows "imported · new turns" badges, pages large indexes, and ships zh/en texts (B1/D4/D3).
- `resumeMode` config: `'agents'` resumes through `ctx.agents.resume` and falls back to the handoff inject (D2).
- `/resume-claude` exact-id fast path via the imports map + index bookmarks, and a single read of the transcript for import + handoff (A6).
- Tool/command descriptions are now bilingual (English primary + Chinese) (D3).
- **Dedicated `claudecode` workspace (default, E2)**: `workspaceMode: 'claudecode'` groups every imported session into one "claudecode" workspace rooted at `claudecodeDir` (default `$DSH_HOME/claudecode`; the only intentional write the plugin ever makes is `mkdir` there). `workspaceMode: 'per-project'` keeps the previous one-workspace-per-project behavior. The source project cwd is preserved in `imports.json` (`sourceCwd`) and recovered at prompt-assembly time (`sourceCwdSync`) so current-project memory and project `CLAUDE.md` keep resolving; `/resume-claude` handoffs state the original project directory explicitly.
- **Interrupted tool-call repair (issue #1)**: every declared `tool_use` now gets exactly one `tool/result` — real results are deduplicated (first wins), interrupted calls get one synthetic error result, orphan results are dropped. Counters (`repaired.synthesized/duplicateResults/orphanResults`) surface in import reports, handoffs, and the schema; `validateSessionEvents` self-checks the balance and refuses to persist any log that fails it (loud error, both full and streamed paths), so imported sessions never end up with the permanent 400 "tool_call_ids did not have response messages" failure.
- **Skill-candidate hardening (issue #1)**: `README.md`/`MEMORY.md` are never registered as skills; skill files without a non-empty `name`/`description` are skipped (DSH hard-requires a description and otherwise fails the whole skill load). Frontmatter scalars are now unquoted before validation.
- **Safety tripwire test** (`test/safety.test.mjs`): the shipped sources are statically audited — no `rm`/`unlink`/`truncate`/`writeFileSync`/`archiveSession` anywhere except the two named cache files in `resetCacheFiles`, `recursive: true` only with `mkdir`/`readdir`/`importDirectory`, and the client panel only ever requests `/api/claude-move/*`.

### Changed

- The panel starts collapsed (floating button only) and shows an explicit "panel routes disabled" state when `enableWebPanel: false` (A1/A2).
- `imports.json` writes are serialized through an atomic write (temp + rename) and per-source in-flight locks; concurrent imports of the same file reuse the first result (A4).
- Re-import recovers half-created sessions (created but empty log) by appending to the same id instead of minting a suffix copy (A5).
- Import status annotation prefers `listSnapshots` and lazily cleans up import-map entries whose DSH session was deleted, reporting the count (B4).
- Claude `summary` records are reported in results and the handoff (not synthesized into compaction nodes — documented in OPTIMIZATION.md) (D1).
- Removed `"private": true` so `npm publish` works as documented (A3).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-14

### Changed

- License: the project is now licensed under the **Apache License 2.0** (previously MIT). `LICENSE` replaced, a `NOTICE` file added, SPDX identifiers added to shipped sources, and `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` now carries the full MIT text required by the vendored MIT components (which keep their own licenses).
- Copy-only force re-import: `force: true` now saves a fresh full copy under `import-<src>-<n>` and keeps the previous copy untouched. Imported sessions are never archived, deleted, rewritten, or hidden.
- Incremental sync: re-importing a transcript that grew since the last import appends only the new turns to the same DSH session (contiguous seq); a transcript modified within an already-imported turn is reported as `changedInPlace` and left untouched; a truncated source reports `sourceShrunk`.
- Workspace mirroring: one workspace per Claude project directory (`cwd`), with every imported session attached to its own project's workspace; attach failures now carry a `reason`.
- Import reporting: batch results include an `appended` counter; panel and `/claude-import-all` state explicitly that no DSH restart is needed (refresh the open Web page once instead).

### Added

- Auto-discovery of the Claude data root with streaming scan, incremental cache, project/session/git/memory/skill index, and the `claude_scan` tool.
- Full-fidelity history import (`import_claude`): balanced, resumable DSH sessions, per-`cwd` workspace attach, batch import, line-numbered malformed-line reporting, secret position-only warnings, permission-record accounting.
- Personal context: live memory injection, Claude skills provider, global + project `CLAUDE.md` prompt section, `settings.json` translation suggestions.
- User commands `/claude-import-all` and `/resume-claude` (handoff summary with the resume-plugin safety model).
- Web migration panel (`dsh.client`) with `/api/claude-move/*` JSON routes.
- Tool contract hardening: `claude_scan` / `import_claude` honor `exec.signal` (scan aborts per line/project; batch import aborts between files and before each persist) and throw `signal.reason` on abort.
- `importConcurrency` config (default 4): batch import reads + converts files concurrently, then persists in deterministic filename order (id suffix avoidance and the import map stay order-dependent and serial).
- `gitTimeoutMs` config (default 5000): the git subprocess timeout is no longer hardcoded.
- GitHub Actions CI running the full test suite on Node 22 (100/100, green).
- Issue templates (bug report, feature request), a social preview card (`assets/social-card.png`), and a GitHub Release for `v0.1.0`.
- GitHub-style README polish in all five languages: highlight pills, feature grid, quick start, data-flow diagram, emoji sections, and `dsh` / `dsh-plugin` topic badges.
- Documentation: five-language README, PLAN, ARCHITECTURE, COMPLIANCE, OPTIMIZATION, RELEASE, THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.
